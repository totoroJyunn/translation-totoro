# translation-totoro
Totoro’s Translation is a lifelong, bilingual archive. Books, essays, and 100分de名著 are shown Japanese–Chinese side by side. All translations are free, not for profit, and may be modified with source credited. I translate not because I am gifted, but because I cannot abandon understanding.
